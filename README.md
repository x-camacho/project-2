Mech Keyboard Builder
In this section of the repo we go over the thought process and story creation of our fun keyboard web application. 
Inspired as a simple conversation of hobbies sparked an idea to help new hobbyists. 
With this application we have created a simple tutorial website for those wishing for more click in their clack.

## Concept: 
Similar to a fancy pen used to write. The new digital age requires us to constantly smash on our keyboards for what seems like hours.
So if we have to use a keyboard for so long everyday why don't we try to get the best feel and experience we want?
It is because many people do not know how to create their own keyboard or even where to start.
This website serves as a one stop site for people to save and create their own potential keyboard. Each user would be able to create 
as many keyboards as they want and alter the keyboards that they create. Another page will help provide an first look on what 
aspects of the keyboard they would need to be aware of. Simply put, the web application will help new hobbyists for keyboards to 
learn how to create a new keyboard and to save and update existing keyboards that they have created.

## Brainstorm
Together, we came up with this idea after hearing the sheer acoustics of a premium keyboard.
